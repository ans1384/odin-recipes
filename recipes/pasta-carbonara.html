        <p><strong> Crispy pork and chewy pasta come together in just minutes for this rich twist on an Italian classic.</strong></p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>6 ounces guanciale or pancetta, cut into 1/4-inch dice</li>
    <li>Kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 pound rigatoni or spaghetti</li>
    <li>5 large egg yolks</li>
    <li>1 large egg</li>
    <li>1 cup freshly grated Pecorino Romano cheese, divided</li>
    <li>3/4 teaspoon crushed red pepper</li>
    <li>Freshly ground black pepper</li>
</ul>
<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
    <li>In a small skillet, cook guanciale over fairly low heat, stirring  until the fat is rendered, about 15 minutes. Let cool.</li>
    <li>Meanwhile, in a large pot of heavily salted boiling water, cook the pasta until al dente. Drain, reserving 1 cup of the cooking water.</li>
    <li>In a large bowl, whisk the yolks and egg with the guanciale and the leftover fat. Add the pasta, 1/4 cup of the reserved pasta water, and 2/3 cup of the cheese to the egg mixture and toss until creamy, about 1 minute; add more reserved cooking water if necessary. Add the crushed red pepper and season with salt and pepper.</li>
<li>Serve in shallow bowls, sprinkled with the remaining cheese. Enjoy!</li>
